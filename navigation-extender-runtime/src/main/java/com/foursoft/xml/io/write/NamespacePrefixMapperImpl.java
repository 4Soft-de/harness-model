     * @param namespaceUri
     *      The namespace URI for which the prefix needs to be found.
     *      Never be null. "" is used to denote the default namespace.
     * @param suggestion
     *      When the content tree has a suggestion for the prefix
     *      to the given namespaceUri, that suggestion is passed as a
     *      parameter. Typicall this value comes from the QName.getPrefix
     *      to show the preference of the content tree. This parameter
     *      may be null, and this parameter may represent an already
     *      occupied prefix.
     * @param requirePrefix
     *      If this method is expected to return non-empty prefix.
     *      When this flag is true, it means that the given namespace URI
     *      cannot be set as the default namespace.
     *
     * @return
     *      null if there's no prefered prefix for the namespace URI.
     *      In this case, the system will generate a prefix for you.
     *
     *      Otherwise the system will try to use the returned prefix,
     *      but generally there's no guarantee if the prefix will be
     *      actually used or not.
     *
     *      return "" to map this namespace URI to the default namespace.
     *      Again, there's no guarantee that this preference will be
     *      honored.
     *
     *      If this method returns "" when requirePrefix=true, the return
     *      value will be ignored and the system will generate one.
